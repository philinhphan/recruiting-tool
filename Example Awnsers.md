One significant challenge I faced was optimizing the code for a resource-constrained microcontroller. The robot's performance was lagging due to inefficient memory usage and slow processing speed. To address this, I refactored the code to reduce memory leaks and implemented more efficient algorithms. I also utilized direct register manipulation for time-critical operations and optimized the use of data structures.


Working independently on robotics projects has honed my problem-solving skills and ability to manage projects from conception to completion. For example, designing and building a small autonomous robot required me to plan, execute, and troubleshoot effectively. During my internship at Borm Informatik AG, I collaborated with a team on a software development project.


I am particularly interested in autonomous systems and human-robot interaction. These fields fascinate me because they combine advanced programming, sensor integration, and machine learning to create intelligent systems.
Future Projects/Roles: I aim to work on projects that involve developing robotic systems for real-world applications, such as healthcare or search-and-rescue missions.
